# Data Folder

In this folder you will have all dataset related files. Here's where the training and testing code expects the dataset csvs to be. You will also be able to experiment with preprocessing before the actual training on data.

## Folders
* [__cross_validation/:__](./cross_validation/) This folder will create the csvs files containing the dataset which models are going to train with.
* [__preprocessing/:__](./preprocessing) Here you will be able to play with your data and experiment with feature exploration.
